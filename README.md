# color-bling
Color-Bling. The idea is to try to replicate Color Switch game in c++. 
It was my first OOP project back in 2nd semester.

Dependencies: 
cglass.h
glut.h (for drawing lines)
irrklang (for adding sound)

Procedure:
Copy the dll files from glut.h and irrklang to C:/Windows/System & C:/Windows/System32

Copy the lib files from glut and irrklang to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\lib

Copy the .h files (cglass.h, glut.h and all .h files from irrklang) to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\include

Copy the .tga figures and .wav sounds to the root project directory (where source.cpp file resides). Also add your own wav file named "music2.wav" here for background music for the game
