# color-bling
Color-Bling. The idea is to try to replicate Color Switch game in c++. It was my first OOP project back in 2nd semester.

Dependencies: 
cglass.h
glut.h (for drawing lines)
irrklang (for adding sound)

Procedure:
Copy the dll files from glut.h and irrklang to C:/Windows/System & C:/Windows/System32
Copy the lib files from glut and irrklang to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\lib
Copy the .h files (cglass.h, glut.h and all .h files from irrklang) to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\include
